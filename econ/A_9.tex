    The continuous that denotes the interval length between the occurrence of events is called exponential random variable. The associated probability function is known as the expnenetial probability function, which is defined as follows -
    $$f(x) = \frac{1}{\mu}\;e^{-\frac{x}{\mu}};\hspace{1em}\text{for } x\geq 0$$
    where $\mu=$ expected value or mean\\

    Some real life example of exponential random variable:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Insurers use it to determine the risk of client gettting in an accident.
        \item To find out the interval between earthquakes.
        \item To determine the life of electrical devices.
        \item To determine the interval of getting mails.
    \end{itemize}
